Plugin starts a countdown timer after login and if the timer is count to zero, the user is automatically logged out.
The timer is restarted each time a user clicks on "something" like a tab-change. 

#### Support my Efforts

This plugin, as well as my [other plugins](https://github.com/OllisGit/) were developed in my spare time.
If you like it, I would be thankful about a cup of coffee :)
